Here are some follow-up actions based on the conversation summary and provided documents:

*   **Send a Thank You Email:** Craft a personalized thank you email to Ashley Perez, reiterating appreciation for her positive feedback on the Camera Pro One. Acknowledge her specific points about image quality and ease of use. This reinforces her positive experience and strengthens brand loyalty.

*   **Request a Review/Testimonial:** Given her enthusiasm, politely ask if she would be willing to leave a review on the company website or a relevant platform. Alternatively, ask if she would be open to providing a short testimonial that can be used for marketing purposes (with her explicit consent, of course). This leverages her positive experience to attract new customers.

*   **Offer a Small Token of Appreciation (Optional):** Consider offering a small token of appreciation, such as a discount code for a future purchase or a free accessory related to the Camera Pro One (e.g., a lens cleaning kit). This goes above and beyond and further solidifies her positive perception of the company. This should be done within budgetary constraints and company policy.
